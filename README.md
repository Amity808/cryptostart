## Start Pay 
-- Introduction 
This is a decentralized platform for payment using link as a means of payment. This platform allows users to gift their family and friends using our dapp. This allows users to pay for any transaction through a link rather than looking for a wallet address before they can make transactions. Users send crypto to family and friends or purchase items with links. Users generate a link, this link is sent to the recipient's email address or copy and paste anywhere they want to send depends on where they are sending it. Users have access to send NFT through their email addresses as well. When user receive the link in their email they claim what they send them either ERC20 or ERC721. This allows fast cross-border payment and promotes cross-border payment without a wallet address before sending and making transactions.

### The problem it solves
Cross-border payments and gifting through cryptocurrencies have always posed significant challenges due to the necessity of knowing the recipient's wallet address. This requirement can be cumbersome, especially for users who are not technically inclined or familiar with the intricate details of crypto transactions. Furthermore, the process of sending and receiving NFTs (ERC721 tokens) is equally complex, often necessitating multiple steps and a thorough understanding of blockchain technology.
